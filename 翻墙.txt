I feel like I'm losing hope

In my body and my soul

And the sky, it looks so ominous

And as time comes to a halt

Silence starts to overflow

My cries are inconspicuous

Tell me, God, are you punishing me?

Is this the price I’m paying for my past mistakes?

This is my redemption song

I need you more than ever right now

Can you hear me now?

‘Cause we’re gonna shout it loud

Even if our words seem meaningless

It’s like I’m carrying the weight of the world

I wish that someway, somehow

That I can save everyone of us

But the truth is that I’m only one girl

Maybe if I keep believing my dreams will come to life

Come to life…

After all the laughter fades

Signs of life all washed away

I can still, still feel a gentle breeze

No matter how hard I pray

Signs of warning still remain

And life has become my enemy

Tell me, God, are you punishing me?

Is this the price I’m paying for my past mistakes?

This is my redemption song

I need you more than ever right now

Can you hear me now?

‘Cause we’re gonna shout it loud

Even if our words seem meaningless

It’s like I’m carrying the weight of the world

I wish that someway, somehow

That I can save everyone of us

But the truth is that I’m only one girl

Maybe if I keep believing my dreams will come to life

Come to life…

‘Cause we’re gonna shout it loud

Even if our words seem meaningless

It’s like I’m carrying the weight of the world

I wish that someway, somehow

That I can save everyone of us

But the truth is that I’m only one girl

Still, we’re gonna shout it loud

Even if our words seem meaningless

It’s like I’m carrying the weight of the world

I hope that someway, somehow

That I can save everyone of us

But the truth is that I’m only one girl

Maybe if I keep believing my dreams will come to life

Come to life…
